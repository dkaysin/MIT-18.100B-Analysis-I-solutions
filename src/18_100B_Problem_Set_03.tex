\subsection*{Problem 1}

\begin{tcolorbox}
In vector spaces, metrics are usually defined in terms of norms which measure the length
of a vector.
If $V$ is a vector space defined over $\R$, then a norm is a function from vectors to real numbers, denoted by $\norm{ \cdot }$ satisfying:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\norm{x} \geq 0$ and $\norm{x}=0 \iff x = 0$
    \item For any $\lambda \in \R, \norm{ \lambda x} = \abs{ \lambda } \norm{ x } $
    \item $\norm{ x+y } \leq \norm{x} + \norm{y }$.
\end{itemize}
Prove that every norm defines a metric.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

For given two vectors $p, q \in V$ and a norm $\norm{ \cdot }$, metric on $V$ can be defined as $d(p, q) = \norm{ p-q }$.
We will check the following properties of this metric:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d(p, q) > 0$ if $p \neq q$; d(p,p)=0
    \item $d(p, q) = d(q, p)$
    \item $d(p, q) \leq d(p, r) + d(r, q)$
\end{itemize}
for $p, q, r \in V$.

We first check that for $p \neq q : d(p, q) = \norm{ p-q } = \norm{ x } > 0$ for some $x \in V$. We also note that $d(p, p) = \norm{ p-p } = \norm{ 0 } = 0$.

We then check that $d(p, q) = \norm{ p-q } = \norm{ -1 \cdot (q-p) } = \abs{-1} \norm{ q-p } = d (q, p)$.
Finally, we check that 
\[ d(p, q) \leq d(p, r) + d(r, q) \]
Indeed
\begin{gather*}
    \norm{ p-q } \leq \norm{ p-r } + \norm{ r-q } \\ 
    \norm{ (p-r) + (r-q) } \leq \norm{ p-r } + \norm{ r-q }    
\end{gather*}
which is true by the triangle inequality for norms.

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 2}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Let $M$ be a metric space with metric $d$. Show that $d_1$ defined by
\[ d_1 (x, y) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)} \]
is also a metric on $M$. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
We will check whether $d_1$ satisfies properties of a metric. Let $p, q, r \in M$. Denote $a = d(p, q)$.

We first check that for $p \neq q : d_1(p, q) = 0 $.
\[ d_1(p, q) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)} = \frac{a}{1+a} > 0 \]

We also check that for $p = q : d_1(p, q) = 0$.
\[ d_1(p, q) = \frac{0}{1+0} = 0 \]

We then check that $d_1(p, q) = d_1(q, p)$.
\begin{gather*}
    d(p, q) = d(q, p) = a \\
    d_1(p, q) = \frac{a}{1+a} = d_1(q, p)    
\end{gather*}

We finally check the triangle inequality for $d_1$:
\[ d_1(p, q) \leq d_1(p, r) + d_1(r, q) \]
Let $d(p, q) = a, \> d(p, r) = b, \> d(r, q) = c$.
We now prove that
\begin{gather*}
    \frac{a}{1+a} \leq \frac{b}{1+b} + \frac{c}{1+c} \\
    a(1+b)(1+c) \leq (1+a)(b+c+2bc) \\
    a+ab+ac+abc \leq b+c+2bc+ab+ac+2abc \\
    a \leq b+c+bc+abc
\end{gather*}

Since $d$ is a metric: $a \leq b+c$:
\begin{gather*}
    a \leq a+bc+abc \\
    0 \leq bc+abc    
\end{gather*}
Which is always true because $a,b,c > 0$.

Since function $d_1$ satisfies all properties of a metric, it is a metric.

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Observe that $M$ itself is bounded in this metric.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

We notice that set $D = \set{ d_1(p,q) : p,q \in \R_{\geq 0} }$ is bounded.
$D$ is bounded from below by $0$ since metric has a property of non-negativity.
$D$ is clearly bounded from above by $1$.

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 3}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of a metric space $M$.
Recall that $A^\circ$, the interior of $A$, is the set of interior points of $A$.
Prove the following:

a) $A^\circ \cup B^\circ \subseteq (A \cup B)^\circ $
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Consider $a \in A^\circ$ and $b \in B^\circ$.
By definition of interior point we can find open neighbourhoods $N(a) \subset A$ and $N(b) \subset B$.

For any sets $S, X, Y$:
\[ S \subset X \Rightarrow Y \subset (X \cup Y) \]
Therefore, $N(a) \subset A \cup B$ and $N(b) \subset A \cup B$.
Thus, both points $a$ and $b$ are interior points of $A \cup B$.
This should hold not only for metric spaces.

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
b) $ A^\circ \cap B^\circ = (A \cap B)^\circ $
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

A point belongs to intersection of two sets if and only if it belongs to both sets. 
Consider point $x$ that belongs to intersection of interiors of $A$ and $B$ ($x \in A^\circ, x \in B^\circ$).
By definition of interior point we can find open neighbourhoods $N_a(x) \subset A$ and $N_b(x) \subset B$.
Thus intersection of neighbourhoods $N_a(x) \cap N_b(x)$ lies within $A \cap B$.
Thus, point $x$ is an interior point of $A \cap B$, or:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    A^\circ \cap B^\circ \subseteq (A \cap B)^\circ
\end{equation}

Now consider $y$, interior point of intersection of $A$ and $B$ ($y \in (A \cap B)^\circ$).
Since $y$ is interior, we can find an open neighbourhood $N_{ab}(y) \in (A \cap B)$. 
Furthermore, $N_{ab}(y)$ must be a subset of both $A$ and $B$ and thus has open neighbourhoods in $A$ and in $B$.
Therefore $y$ is an interior point of both $A$ and $B$, or:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
(A \cap B)^\circ \subseteq A^\circ \cap B^\circ
\end{equation}

Considering expressions (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{eq:2}), we conclude that
$ A^\circ \cap B^\circ = (A \cap B)^\circ $.
This should hold not only for metric spaces

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Give an example of two subsets $A$ and $B$ of the real line such that
$A^\circ \cup B^\circ \neq (A \cup B)^\circ $.
\end{tcolorbox}

Answer: $A = \Q, \> B = \R \setminus \Q$.

\begin{proof}

Since $\Q$ is dense in $\R$, every neighbourhood of every point of both sets $\Q$ and $\R \setminus \Q$ contains infinitely many points of both $\Q$ and $\R \setminus \Q$.
This means that no point of these sets is interior:
\[ \Q^\circ = \emptyset, \>\> (\R \setminus \Q)^\circ = \emptyset \]

However, interior of the union of these sets is $\R$:
\[ (\Q \cup (\R \setminus \Q))^\circ = \R^\circ = \R. \]

Therefore:
\[ \Q^\circ + (\R \setminus \Q)^\circ \neq (\Q \cup (\R \setminus \Q))^\circ. \]

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 4}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Let $A$ be a subset of a metric space $M$.
Recall that $\overline{A}$, the closure of $A$, is the union of $A$ and its limit points.
Recall that a point $x$ belongs to the boundary of $A$, $\partial A$, if every open ball centered at $x$ contains points of $A$ and points of $A^c$, the complement of $A$. Prove that:

a) $\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c}$
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Note: We shall prove validity of claims a)-d) for general topological spaces that do not necessarily have a metric.

Consider point $p \in \partial A$. Every neighbourhood of $p$ must contain points of both $A$ and $A^c$.
Thus every neighbourhood of $p$ must contain points of $A$, so $p \in \overline{A}$.
Every neighbourhood of $p$ must also contain points of $A^c$, so $p \in \overline{A^c}$. 
Since $p$ is both an element of set $\overline{A}$ and of set $\overline{A^c}$, $p$ must be an element of $\overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c}$, so:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
    \partial A \subseteq \overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c}
\end{equation}

Now consider point $p \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c}$.
Point $p$ must belong to the set $\overline{A}$, thus every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain elements of $A$.
Point $p$ must also belong to the set $\overline{A^c}$, thus every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain elements of $A^c$.
We can see that every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain elements of both $A$ and $A^c$m so $p$ must lie in the boundary of $A$, or:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
    \overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c} \subseteq \partial A
\end{equation}

Considering expressions (\ref{eq:3}) and (\ref{eq:4}) we can see that $\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{A^c}$.

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
b) $p \in \partial A \iff p$ is in $\overline{A}$ but not in $A^\circ$
(symbolically, $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus A^\circ$)
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Consider $p \in \partial A$.
Every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain both points of $A$ and points of $A^c$.
Since every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain points of $A$, $p$ must be an element of $\overline{A}$, so:
\[ A \subseteq \overline{A} \]
Furthermore, since every open neighbourhood of $p$ must contain points of $A^c$, such neighbourhood cannot be a subset of A, so $p$ cannot be a interior point.
Therefore
\[ A \nsubseteq A^\circ \]
We conclude that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
    \partial A \subseteq \overline{A} \setminus A^\circ
\end{equation}

Now consider $p \in \overline{A} \setminus A^\circ$. Since $p$ is an element of $\overline{A}$, every neighbourhood of $p$ must contain points of $A$.
Since $p$ cannot be an element of $A^\circ$, every neighbourhood of $p$ includes points that belong to $A^c$.
Therefore every neighbourhood of $p$ includes both points of $A$ and points of $A^c$ and we conclude that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
    \overline{A} \setminus A^\circ \subseteq \partial A
\end{equation}

Considering expressions \ref{eq:5} and \ref{eq:6} we can see that $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus A^\circ$. 

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
c) $\partial A$ is a closed set
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Set $\partial A$ is closed if it contains all its limit points.
If the set of limit points of $\partial A$ is not $\emptyset$, consider an arbitrary limit point $p$ of $\partial A$.
Now we will prove that $p$ is a boundary point of $A$.
Consider $N(p)$, an arbitrary open neighbourhood of $p$.
Since $p$ is a limit point, $N(p)$ must contain points of $\partial A$ other than $p$. 
Denote $q : q \in \partial A, q \in N(p)$ one of these points.
Every open neighbourhood of $q$ must contain points that lie in $A$ and in $A^c$ by definition of boundary.
Notice that $N(p)$ is an open neighbourhood of $q$.
Thus $N(p)$ must include points that lie in $A$ and in $A^c$.
Therefore, $p$ is a boundary point of $A$.
We conclude that all limit points of $\partial A$ lie in $\partial A$, or set $\partial A$ is closed. 

If the set of limit points of $\partial A$ is $\emptyset$ we note that $\emptyset \subseteq \partial A$.
In this case, vacuously, $\partial A$ is a closed set.

\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
d) $A$ is closed $\iff \partial A \subseteq A$ 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Consider $b$, a boundary point of a closed set $A$.
Consider an arbitrary open neighbourhood of $b$: $N(b)$.
Since $b$ is a boundary point, $N(b)$ contains at least one point of $A$ and at least one point of $A^c$.
Consider an arbitrary point $p \in A$ that lies in $N(b)$.
Either $p = b$ or $p \neq b$. If $p = b$, then $p = b \in A$, so $b$, a boundary point of $A$, is an element of $A$.
If $p \neq b$, then $b$ must be a limit point.
But then we know that a closed set contains all its limit points, thus $b$, a boundary point of $A$, is an element of $A$.
We conclude that if $A$ is closed then $\partial A \subseteq A$.

Now consider a set $A$ such that $\partial A \subseteq A$.
Suppose $p$ is a limit point of $A$ such that $p \notin A$. Then $p \in A^c$.
Therefore each open neighbourhood of $p$ must include points of $A$ (since it is a limit point of $A$) and at least one point of $A^c$, specifically $p$.
But then $p$ must be a boundary point of $A$ and since $\partial A \subseteq A$, $p$ must be an element of $A$, which presents a contradiction.
Therefore, $p$, a limit point of $A$ must be a point of $A$. We conclude that if $\partial A \subseteq A$ then $A$ is closed.

Thus, $A$ is closed $\iff$ $\partial A \subseteq A$.

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 5}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Show that, in $\R^n$ with the usual (Euclidean) metric, the closure of the open ball $B_R(p), R > 0$, is the closed ball
\[ \set{ q \in \R^n : d(p ,q) \leq R }. \]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

We claim that for every metric space $M$ with metric that is induced by a norm, closure of an open ball is a closed ball:
\[ \overline{B_R(p)} = B_R[p] \]
where
\begin{align*}
    B_R(p) & = \set{ r : d(p, r) < R } \\
    B_R[p] & = \set{ r : d(p, r) \leq R }     
\end{align*}
and $ d(p, r) = \norm{ p-r }$ for some norm $\norm{ \cdot }; \> R>0 $.

Set $B_R[p]$ is closed since it contains all its limit points.
Suppose, there exists $x$, a limit point of $B_R[p]$, that belongs to $B_R[p]^c = \set{ r: d(p, r) > R}$.
Set $B_R[p]^c$ is open, so all its points internal to itself.
This means that for such $x$ we can find an open ball that is a subset of $B_R[p]^c$.
But then, it cannot contain points of $B_R[p]$, which is a contradiction with $x$ being a limit point of $B_R[p]$.
Thus, $B_R[p]$ contains all its limit points and is closed.
We also note that set $B_R(p)m \subseteq B_R[p]$.
Closure of $B_R(p)$ is the smallest closed subset that includes $B_R(p)$, therefore it is a subset of any closed set that includes $B_R(p)$, including $\subseteq B_R[p]$:
\[ \overline{B_R(p)} \subseteq B_R[p] \]

Consider $r \in B_R[p]$.
We will prove that $r \in \overline{B_R(p)}$.
We need to prove that $r$ is either an element or a limit point of $B_R(p)$.
All $r$ such that $d(p, r) < R$ are clearly elements of $B_R(p)$.
The set of remaining points is $B_R[p] \setminus B_R(p)$.
All points of this set are given by $\set{r: d(p, r) = R }$.
Point $r$ is a limit point of $B_R(p)$ if every open ball $B_\epsilon(r)$ contains at least one point $x$ such that $x \in B_R(p) \iff d(p, x) < R$.
We can find such $x$ explicitly, provided $M$ is a normed vector space, which follows from existence of norm $\norm{ \cdot }$ for M.

We claim that 
\[ x = r + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{1}{d(p, r)}(p-r) \]
is such a point.
To prove this we show that $d(r, x) < \epsilon$ and $d(p, x) < R$.
\begin{multline*}
    d(r, x) = \norm{r-x} 
    = \norm*{ r - r + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{1}{d(p,r)}(p-r) } \\
    =\norm*{ \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{1}{d(p,r)}(p-r) }
    = \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{\norm{p-r}}{d(p,r)} = \frac{\epsilon}{2} < \epsilon.    
\end{multline*}
Thus $x$ lies in $B_\epsilon(r)$.
\begin{multline*}
    d(p, x) = \norm{p-x} = \norm*{ p - r - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{1}{d(p,r)}(p-r) } \\
    = \norm*{ (p - r)\left(1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{1}{d(p,r)}\right) } = \left(1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{1}{d(p,r)}\right) d(p, r) \\
    = d(p, r) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq R - \frac{\epsilon}{2} < R.    
\end{multline*}
Thus $x$ lies in $B_R(p)$.

Therefore all points in $B_R[p]$ are either elements of $B_R(p)$ or its limit points, thus are elements of the closure of $B_R(p)$:
\[ B_R[p] \subseteq \overline{B_R(p)} \]
We conclude that:
\[ \overline{B_R(p)} = B_R[p] \]

\begin{tcolorbox}
Give an example of a metric space for which the corresponding statement is false.
\end{tcolorbox}

This may not be the case for metrics that are not induced by a norm. For example, for discreet metric on $\R$, which is not induced by a norm,
\[
    d(x, y) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{ if} x = y,\\
    1, & \text{ if} x \neq y
    \end{cases}
\]
open ball $B_1(0) = {0}$, closed ball $B_1[0] = \R$ and closure of $\overline{B_1(0)} = {0}$. Clearly
\[ \overline{B_1(0)} \subseteq B_1[0] \]
but
\[ \overline{B_1(0)} \neq B_1[0]. \]

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 6}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Prove directly from the definition that the set $K \subseteq \R$ given by
\[ K = \set*{ 0, 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \dots , \frac{1}{n}, \dots } \]
is compact.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Let $C$ be an open cover of $K$, i.e. a collection of open sets such that:
\[ K \subseteq \bigcup_{S \in C} S \]
For each $k \in K$ we can find a set within the collection $C$ that contains $k$ (not necessarily unique).
Denote such open set $C(k)$.

Specifically, for $0 \in K$ there must exist open set $C(0)$.
Since $C(0)$ is open, it must contain some open ball $B_\epsilon(0)$.
We notice that $B_\epsilon(0)$ contains all points of $K$ that are less than $\epsilon$:
\[ x \in K : x < \epsilon \Rightarrow x \in B_\epsilon(0) \]

We can see that there are only finitely many points of $K$ that are greater than or equal to $\epsilon$.
Such points can be covered by union of finitely many open sets $C(k)$.
The rest of the points of $K$ can be covered by $B_\epsilon(0)$.

Therefore the following finite collection covers $K$:
\[ \set{ C(k) : k \in K, k \geq \epsilon }  \cup \set{ B_\epsilon(0) } \]
We conclude that $K$ is compact.

\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 7}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Let $K$ be a compact subset of a metric space $M$, and let $\set{ \mathcal{U}_\alpha }_{\alpha \in A}$ be an open cover of $K$.
Show that there is a positive real number $\delta$ with the property that for every $x \in K$ there is some $\alpha \in A$ with
\[ B_\delta(x) \subseteq \mathcal{U}_\alpha \]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}

Since all sets in collection $\mathcal{U}$ are open, for each $x \in K$ there must exist an open ball $B_{\epsilon(x)}(x)$ where $\epsilon(x) > 0$ that is a subset of some $\mathcal{U}_\alpha, \alpha \in A$.
Open ball with half the radius, $B_{\epsilon(x) / 2}(x)$, is also a subset of the same $\mathcal{U}_\alpha$.
Collection of such open balls with half the radius, $\mathcal{H}$, is an open cover of $K$ since each $x \in K$ belongs to at least one of the open sets in collection $\mathcal{H}$.

Since $K$ is compact, there must exist a finite subcover $\mathcal{F} \in \mathcal{H}$ that covers $K$.
Since collection $\mathcal{F}$ is finite, we can enumerate all its sets:
\[ B_{\epsilon(x_1) / 2}(x_1), \>\> B_{\epsilon(x_2) / 2}(x_2), \>\> \dots, \>\> B_{\epsilon(x_N) / 2}(x_N) \]
where $N \in \N$.
Radius of each of these open balls must be strictly greater than zero.
Find the minimum of these radii:
\[ \delta = \min \set{ \epsilon(x_n) / 2 : n \in \N, 1 \leq n \leq N }, \]
which will be also strictly greater than zero.
We claim that $\delta$ satisfies the desired property for $K$ and $\mathcal{U}$.

We prove that for any $x \in K$ open ball $B_\delta(x)$ is a subset of at least one of the sets of the collection $\mathcal{U}$.
Indeed, every $x \in K$ must belong to at least one of the sets of its open cover $\mathcal{F}$; denote such set $B_{\epsilon(x_k)/2}(x_k)$.
We notice that
\[ B_{\epsilon(x_k)/2}(x_k) \subset B_{\epsilon(x_k)}(x_k)\] 
and since $\delta \leq \epsilon(x_k)/2$:
\[ B_\delta(x) \subset B_{\epsilon(x_k)}(x_k) \subseteq \mathcal{U}_\alpha, \text{ for some } \alpha \in A \]
Therefore, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for any point in $K$ there exists an open ball with radius $\delta$ that is a subset of at least one set of an open cover of $K$.

\end{proof}
